# NFT_Simple_Analysis
This repo is created to display some basic analysis of NFTs. All the analysis was made using Microsoft Power BI\
and the resulting dashboard was exported to a .pdf file. The file NFT_Sales.csv contains the data that was used\
for the analysis. It was downloaded from [kaggle] and represents information about the number of sales of NFTs,\
number of active wallets, total NFT sales price, etc.
